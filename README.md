Web framework for DRY enthusiasts - Simple, DRY, only 1 way to do a task


WishList
* ORM to deal with DB hostilities. An automatic connection manager for the same
* A Firm URL base
* A templating engine
* A Form engine
* A Caching engine
* A session engine
* A middleware engine
* An Admin
* Auto Start CLI tool like nodemon
* Settings Module 
* Email module
* Logging
* Testing Framework ?
* AWS Services Wrapper
* Command line opts -- > Optimist, etc
* Documentation support --> apiDoc
* DB Migrations ? --> Not very important, maybe in phase 2

Modules forming Basic building blocks
* ORM : Still not sure if we can use bookshelf or it would be better to start with Mysql and go to postgres
* URL Base : Can be provided by express
* Templating Engine : Would prefer something like Jinja2 ==> probably swig or handlebars/ moustache
* Admin -> Probably Express-Admin or would have to build from scratch
